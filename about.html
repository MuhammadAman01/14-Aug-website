        <h1 class="history">History of Pakistan : </h1><hr>
        <P>The journey of Pakistan from a dependent British colony to an independent nation is a complex and monumental
            chapter in South Asian history, spanning several decades of political, social, and cultural movements. The
            story
            of its independence is rooted in the "Two-Nation Theory," which argued that Hindus and Muslims were two
            distinct
            nations and therefore required separate homelands. </p>

        <h2 class="under">
            <p> Here is a timeline of the key events that led to Pakistan's independence:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <p>1) 1857: Early Seeds of Separation (Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries) :</h2>
                The War of Independence: After a failed uprising against British rule, the British Crown took direct
                control
                of the subcontinent from the East India Company. This event solidified British control and also
                highlighted
                the
                growing divide between Muslims and Hindus, with Muslims often being blamed for the rebellion.</p>

            <h3>
                <p> 2) 1885: Indian National Congress (INC) Founded:
            </h3> The INC was established to push for greater self-governance. However,
            Muslims felt their interests were not adequately represented in the Hindu-majority organization.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <p>3) 1906: All-India Muslim League (AIML) Formed:
            </h3> To safeguard the rights of the Muslim minority, a political party was
            founded in Dhaka. This marked a crucial step in the formal organization of a separate Muslim political
            identity.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <p>4) 1909: Morley-Minto Reforms:
            </h3>The British introduced separate electorates for Muslims, allowing them to elect their
            own representatives. This was a significant political development that formally recognized a distinct Muslim
            political identity within British India.</p>

            <h3>
                <p> 5) 1930: The Idea of a Separate Homeland (1930s-1940s):
            </h3> Allama Muhammad Iqbal's Allahabad Address: The renowned poet and philosopher, Allama Iqbal, proposed
            the
            idea
            of a separate state for the Muslim-majority areas in the northwestern part of India. This was a powerful
            intellectual and ideological foundation for the future state.</p>

            <h3>
                <p>6) 1940: Lahore Resolution:
            </h3> This is considered the most pivotal moment in the Pakistan Movement. The AIML, led by
            Muhammad Ali Jinnah, formally adopted a resolution at its annual session in Lahore demanding "independent
            states"
            for the Muslim-majority areas. While the name "Pakistan" was not explicitly used in the resolution, it
            became a
            clear and official demand for a separate nation.</p>

            <h3>
                <p> 7) 1946: Elections and Political Crisis:
            </h3> The Muslim League won the majority of Muslim seats in the elections,
            demonstrating widespread support for their demand for a separate state. However, negotiations between the
            Muslim
            League, the Congress, and the British government over the transfer of power reached a deadlock, leading to
            increased
            communal violence.</p>
            <h3>
                <p>8)
                    The Final Push for Independence (1947)
                    June 3, 1947:
            </h3> Mountbatten Plan: Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, announced a plan for the
            partition of the Indian subcontinent into two independent dominions: India and Pakistan. This plan was
            accepted
            by
            both the Congress and the Muslim League.
            <h3>
                </p>
                <p> 9)July 18, 1947: Indian Independence Act:
            </h3> The British Parliament passed the act, which formalized the partition and
            set the date for the transfer of power.</p>

            <h3>
                <p>10) August 14, 1947: Independence:
            </h3> Pakistan was born as a new, independent nation, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah as its first
            Governor-General. The creation of the new country involved the partitioning of two provinces, Punjab and
            Bengal,
            and
            led to one of the largest mass migrations in human history, accompanied by immense violence and loss of
            life.

        greatest fast bowlers and batsmen in the history of the sport, including Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis,
        and Javed Miandad. The team has also been ranked as the number one Test team in the world on two occasions (1988
        and 2016).</p>
        <h2>Football:</h2>
